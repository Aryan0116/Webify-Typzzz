I m unpredictable, I never know where I m going until I get there, I m so random, I m always growing, learning, changing, I m never the same person twice. But one thing you can be sure of about me  is I will always do exactly what I want to do.
But that was life Nobody got a guided tour to their own theme park. You had to hop on the rides as they presented themselves, never knowing whether you would like the one you were in line for...or if the bastard was going to make you throw up your corn dog and your cotton candy all over the place.
Some fail to bear in mind that everyone is sentenced to death. Death is a treacherous virus that strikes randomly. The only truth is that nobody is going to make it out alive. We are all living on probation and our expiry date is indefinite. 
The lampshade on my head is for my bright ideas. I wont be able to convey them until Monday, when my curtain gets out of the dry cleaners
All of my best friends are dead people. Someday I have got to figure out how that happened.
The spread of evil is the symptom of a vacuum. whenever evil wins, it is only by default by the moral failure of those who evade the fact that there can be no compromise on basic principles.
Anyone who attempts to generate random numbers by deterministic means is, of course, living in a state of sin.
Many of life failures are people who did not realize how close they were to success when they gave up.
Your time is limited, so do not waste it living someone else life. Do not be trapped by dogma  which is living with the results of other peoples thinking.
Sing like no ones listening, love like you have never been hurt, dance like nobodys watching, and live like its heaven on earth.
Do all the good you can, for all the people you can, in all the ways you can, as long as you can
Life is never easy. There is work to be done and obligations to be met  obligations to truth, to justice, and to liberty.
